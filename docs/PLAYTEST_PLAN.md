# Current Playtest Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-28. Target build: v0.39.53.

## Adventure Test Gate: Passed

The remaining Disbelief and Invisible Gremlins checks passed in live session
`1996ab8f2fc940cc9605f82c88798d26`. The saved state is clean: no pending
Gremlin event, no pending cursed-object choice, no living foes, claimed
treasure, the used Scroll of Disbelief removed from Sir Benedict, and one
scroll retained by each other party member.

The Narrative exposed one final Expanded Edition p.94 **Damage / Foes**
discrepancy: an attack total of 11 against two remaining L3 revealed Gremlins
reported three kills but removed only the selected Gremlin. v0.39.45 caps the
quotient at the remaining group size and applies those kills across the
separately tracked group. Exact automated coverage reproduces the live
`11 / 3` case and proves both remaining Gremlins are removed.

Do not repeat the Gremlin fight or any earlier EE, Abyss, Forsaken Depths,
Citadel, Bofto, Bag, Repellant, treasure, foe, trap, entrance, or closeout
test. Reopen only an exact workflow if a later change produces a confirmed
regression.

## Completed: TAG Rumor 2 Quest Closeout

Live v0.39.53 verification passed in session
`1b417a50983c4329b4f2b1aead6cf76d`:

- the existing Book of Skalitos reward and `9gp` remained unchanged on resume;
- generic Generated lead guidance was replaced by the peaceful Quest result;
- **Return to town and finish** completed the adventure;
- the saved session is `complete`, with no active Quest or pending generated
  closeout, and the roster save completed.

Do not repeat Scene 10, Xasartha's Quest reaction, the 200gp payment, or the
Epic Reward/closeout path.

## Do Next

Resume modularisation with one bounded PDF-backed slice: TAG pp.25-26,
Xasartha's remaining Scene 1/6 paths. Implement and automate the bribe payment,
fight/fight-to-the-death routing, 260gp pendant plus 2d6 necros after defeat,
the explicit try-on versus sell choice, and the rechargeable pendant Luck
effect. Add only narrow automated coverage first; open a new manual adventure
check only for behavior that cannot be established safely in automation.

Convert generated TAG scenes onto typed action definitions one PDF-backed
scene at a time. Inspect and cite the owned PDF scene before coding. Do not
infer procedures from prose or ask the player to choose a dice outcome.

## Automated Coverage Only

Campaign isolation, all Rumors exhausted, exact random dice, Kukla
secret-compartment exposure, Clockwork Armor's two-slot edge, full-party item
exhaustion/Clue creation, Star-Slayer replacement, carrier death,
total-party-kill recovery, mixed-result split fleeing, and the Iron Eater's
temporary-weapon decision remain automated-only checks.

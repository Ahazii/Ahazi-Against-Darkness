# Current Playtest Plan

Last updated: 2026-07-26. Target build: v0.39.45.

## Adventure Test Gate: Passed

The remaining Disbelief and Invisible Gremlins checks passed in live session
`1996ab8f2fc940cc9605f82c88798d26`. The saved state is clean: no pending
Gremlin event, no pending cursed-object choice, no living foes, claimed
treasure, the used Scroll of Disbelief removed from Sir Benedict, and one
scroll retained by each other party member.

The Narrative exposed one final Expanded Edition p.94 **Damage / Foes**
discrepancy: an attack total of 11 against two remaining L3 revealed Gremlins
reported three kills but removed only the selected Gremlin. v0.39.45 caps the
quotient at the remaining group size and applies those kills across the
separately tracked group. Exact automated coverage reproduces the live
`11 / 3` case and proves both remaining Gremlins are removed.

Do not repeat the Gremlin fight or any earlier EE, Abyss, Forsaken Depths,
Citadel, Bofto, Bag, Repellant, treasure, foe, trap, entrance, or closeout
test. Reopen only an exact workflow if a later change produces a confirmed
regression.

## Do Next

Resume modularisation in small tested slices. First consolidate repeated
item-disposition eligibility and container-aware removal behavior without
reorganising `random_dungeon.py`. Preserve cursed-item restrictions, stable
Bag identity and contents, class restrictions, and current player-facing
messages with focused parity tests.

After that slice, convert generated TAG scenes onto typed action definitions
one PDF-backed scene at a time. Do not infer procedures from prose or ask the
player to choose a dice outcome.

## Automated Coverage Only

Campaign isolation, all Rumors exhausted, exact random dice, Kukla
secret-compartment exposure, Clockwork Armor's two-slot edge, full-party item
exhaustion/Clue creation, Star-Slayer replacement, carrier death,
total-party-kill recovery, mixed-result split fleeing, and the Iron Eater's
temporary-weapon decision remain automated-only checks.
